       "\" The 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 electric SUV is likely to turn many more Americans on to the virtues of EVs.\\xa0 Based on all the bugs and hiccups we've seen in its interface, it's not perfect. But a short, one-hour drive among some of the San Francisco Bay Area’s hilly backroads and a stretch on the highway, was enough to confirm some first suspicions and impressions regarding the ID.4, and we came away more confident about its mission. Read this rundown of  2021 VW ID.4 hits and misses  for more up-close takeaways on the ID.4, after we've spent a little more time with this important EV, or read on for those first impressions. It’s not quick, but that’s okay The single-motor versions of the ID.4 that will arrive first make 201 horsepower and 228 pound-feet of torque, with that power delivered by a single electric motor at the rear wheels. A dual-motor, all-wheel drive version with 312 hp is slated for later and that one is sure to be the much quicker of the two.\\xa0  With a roughly estimated 0-60 mph time of around eight seconds, the ID.4 doesn’t make any claims to be a speed demon like some of its other battery-electric SUV counterparts that are busy over there having some kind of a measuring contest. There isn’t the same head-snapping acceleration off-the-line in the ID.4, it eases into motion though it isn’t slow by any means. The throttle is still plenty responsive in all of its drive modes and there was enough power to get the SUV where you want it on highway merges. Where the ID.4 shines is its handling and ride dynamics. Volkswagen’s last full battery-electric car in the U.S., the e-Golf, was pretty great to drive though it suffered from  range issues . It also had an unimpressive 0-60 mph time, but made up for it with precise handling and a road demeanor that was firm enough for fun, but comfortable enough for everyday use. The same thing could be said for the ID.4. Even though it’s nominally an SUV and sits higher than the e-Golf, it exhibited impressive flatness and balance in corners, likely thanks to the new platform and its low center of gravity (thanks batteries).  Of the ID.4’s drive modes my preference was the custom mode—with everything set to Comfort except for the steering, which I turned to Sport to add some weight to it. Without the robust acceleration figures, the ID.4 won’t offer the same hijinks that the Ford Mustang Mach-E and the Tesla Model Y promise, but it’s still an enjoyable steer. And its 0-60 mph time puts it more in line with the ICE compact SUVs that Volkswagen says the ID.4 is supposed to compete against.\\xa0 Range performance The ID.4’s  official range ratings  were released last week, 250 miles for both the Pro S and First Edition models with an efficiency rating of 35 kwh per 100 miles (or for those of you used to miles per kwh, that’s 2.9). An hour long drive wasn’t enough to get a full sense of how that range figure works in the real world but I can report that my drive covered around 30 miles, yet I started with a predicted 165 miles of range and ended with an anticipated 148 miles. I drove about half of the time in drive and half in “B,” which turns up the regenerative braking. The regenerative mode is pretty non-intrusive, it feels more like the “B” mode in a traditional parallel hybrid rather than a battery-electric, the ID.4 won’t offer the same kind of one pedal driving you find in other vehicles. And there’s no way to alter the amount of regenerative braking that the ID.4 uses, strangely. Don’t tell me, show me When I saw the earlier ID.4 prototype in Los Angeles, I got a long disclaimer about the multimedia system not being ready, that it was being worked on, and would be ready for launch. Fast forward nearly a couple months and I got another disclaimer for the newer prototype, though it was not quite as long. The system lags heavily on startup—“give it a few minutes to warm up,” I was told—and that not all of the features are ready yet, including Android Auto.  After the ID.4 took a few minutes to get its bearings, I took a deeper dive into its multimedia system via the 12-inch touchscreen. It moves to a more smartphone-esque interface, like an iPhone laid on its side. There’s a home button on the left side to take you back to the root menu, a screen with large icons for the vehicle’s various functions. Swipe right and there are two other home screens with “widgets” that can be customized to display your most used functions or other information. Similar to the forthcoming Nissan Ariya, the ID.4 looks to get rid of most of the buttons on the dashboard. There are three touch-sensitive sliders below the screen for temperature and volume controls, flanked by a power button on the left side. Below that are four touch-sensitive buttons, which bring up their respective uses on the touchscreen.\\xa0 As a temperature fiddler, I’m wary of putting all of those controls onto the screen, but this integration was fine. It’s fairly easy to get around the screens and there are six “Smart Climate” settings for quick reference, though it does take a few too many screen presses to find the fan speed. The system is an improvement over what Volkswagen currently offers, but this is more of a new version of that software than anything revolutionary. If the smartphone connectivity and laggy startup issues can be solved before launch, then the ID.4 will be fine. But if those persist, or if features that were promised are missing like the ID.3 launch in Europe, then it will be hard to give the ID.4 a whole-throated recommendation. There’s still work to be done. Though the big central screen has gotten more attention, I much more enjoyed the smaller 5.3-inch screen that replaces the traditional gauge cluster. It is not very customizable, but it’s the right size to be digested easily and quickly by the driver. Volkswagen also smartly mounted the screen to the steering wheel column, so it can be seen no matter where you like to have the wheel when you drive. If it had been mounted on the dash, it would have been too easy for the steering wheel to cut off a decent portion of the gauge. The rest of the interior I very much like. It’s roomy and has great sightlines from each of the seats. Even though it’s a RWD vehicle and much of the electric hardware is found up front (no frunk on the ID.4), there’s no seat hump in the rear so you can fit three passengers more comfortably for a short trip. There are lots of plastics used around the interior space, but they have texture and look more expensive than they probably are. That kind of detail matters. At the goal line The 2021 ID.4 is almost there. With its release date fast approaching, enough progress was made that I am feeling more confident that it will be ready than I did in September. The software has made progress and a fully realized version of it will make a better showing. Volkswagen will also perform over-the-air updates on the ID.4, so hopefully those can be used to sort out any lingering issues quickly.  Some bad news: The 1st Edition trim that I tested was limited to 2,000 units and those have already been sold out. The fastest way to get an ID.4 now will be to order a Pro S in RWD guise, those will arrive after the 1st Edition and before the AWD models later in 2021. Those models won’t offer the same kind of discount on options packages the 1st Edition does however. Ultimately, the ID.4 feels like it’s of two worlds: there is a lot of EV in the way it drives, but it’s all at a non-Ludicrous pace that’s more like that of its ICE counterparts. I very much like how the ID.4 drives and I liked how its interior packaging incorporates both form and function into a very usable space that families will appreciate. Once those multimedia gremlins can be expunged, the ID.4 will hold a lot of appeal (especially while VW still has tax credits to offer) for compact SUV buyers who would not have previously considered going electric. -- This piece was originally published on December 7, 2020.\""

      "\n",
      "While in Brussels, Belgium to  drive the 2022 Volvo C40 Recharge  I was given a first look—and some first drive time—at the 2022 Volvo XC60 Recharge T8 plug-in hybrid, which gets that plus more power, and an updated infotainment system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Volvo also anticipates a larger federal tax credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2022 Volvo XC60 plug-in hybrid arrives in the U.S. later this year or early in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "Power, range, battery, and one-pedal driving\n",
      "The largest change starts in the center tunnel of the 2022 XC60 where the battery’s been upgraded to a “three-layer pack,” as Volvo refers to it, with 18.7 kwh of capacity (of which 14.8 kwh is usable) up from 11.6 kwh (of which 9.1 kwh was usable).\n",
      "\n",
      "A more powerful electric motor on the rear axle ups output from 87 hp to 142 hp with total system output from the turbocharged and supercharged inline-4 and PHEV system jumping from 400 hp and 472 lb-ft of torque to 455 hp and 523 lb-ft of torque.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the gas engine isn’t more powerful, it’s been retuned with a new power curve to deliver more thrust at lower speeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Volvo said the XC60 PHEV will increase its all-electric driving range from 19 EPA-rated miles to an anticipated 32 miles, which is a jump of 68%, though the 57 MPGe rating is expected to carry over for 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "The larger battery pack and all-electric range is also expected to increase the XC60’s eligible federal tax credit status from the current $5,419 up to $,7,500.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the larger battery, added power, and increased range comes a feature one can otherwise only find on a fully electric vehicle: one-pedal driving capability thanks to regenerative braking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smoother, more powerful, but not perfect\n",
      "Volvo tossed me the keys to a Silver Dawn 2022 XC60 and as I pulled out of the Brussels airport two things became immediately clear about the upgraded PHEV: one-pedal driving has indeed arrived in Volvo’s plug-in hybrid, and the turbo-4 is smoother.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my very unscientific test loop around the city of Brussels that included both highway and city driving the XC60 did go about 30 miles on electric power, with a caveat: As we observed in a recent  drive of a 2021 XC90 plug-in hybrid , Volvo still won’t let you completely lock out the gasoline engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite having a more powerful electric motor and larger battery pack, if the accelerator pedal is put to the floor, even while in all-electric Pure drive mode, the gas engine will kick in to provide extra juice.\n",
      "\n",
      "This same disappointment takes place in the  Jeep Wrangler 4xe , but not in the  Toyota RAV4 Prime .\n",
      "\n",
      "The one-pedal feature with more regenerative braking works, but the deceleration force isn’t consistent in the way it is with the C40 Recharge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system seemed to be speed-dependent (or perhaps gear-dependent) on the pre-production Euro-spec XC60 PHEV with more regen kicking in at speeds below 40 mph.\n",
      "\n",
      "The slower the speed the stronger the regenerative braking.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn’t possible to one-pedal decelerate the XC60 PHEV from highway speeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entire powertrain’s been smoothed-over, with less-juddery transitions, more power at low speeds when the gas engine is running, and perhaps most welcome, more refined turbocharged and supercharged inline-4 under the hood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as in the C40 Recharge, the system’s less capable in some ways than Volvo’s outgoing Sensus system.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can’t multitask by showing multiple apps running at the same time on the homescreen, rather apps are now always full-screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Volvo UX design manager Anna Arasa Gaspar told  GCR  this was due to customer feedback and not a limitation of the software stack.\n",
      "\n",
      "iPhone users should note Volvo said Apple CarPlay wouldn’t be onboard at launch but will arrive at some point as an over-the-air software update.\n",
      "\n",
      "Better, with more to come\n",
      "The 2022 XC60 plug-in hybrid is the first T8 PHEV Volvo to get the upgraded battery pack, motors, and infotainment system, but not the last.\n",
      "\n",
      "The S60, V60, XC90, and S90 will all get these same upgrades, though Volvo spokesperson Russell Datz told  GCR  timing is unclear and some will be 2022s while others might be for the 2023 model year.\n",
      "\n",
      "With more all-electric range, more power, and a new yet somewhat compromised infotainment system, the updated 2022 XC60 is more of everything wrapped in one of the prettiest designs in the segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will all those “mores” cost more money?\n",
      "\n",
      "Volvo boosted its plug-in hybrid sales by giving them  a big price reduction for 2021 ; and with so much about PHEVs depending on the numbers, we won’t be able to say how these improved models pencil out until closer to market launch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The C40 Recharge isn’t the automaker’s first electric car, but it’s the first model to be sold solely as an EV.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the fastback electric crossover arrives from Ghent, Belgium in the first quarter of 2022 its biggest competitor might just be sitting across the showroom, for a similar price—in the form of the somewhat taller, boxier, more practical but more mundane looking, XC40 Recharge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fashion and style is rarely clear cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "I flew to Brussels, ate some delicious fries, and spent some time driving the 2022 C40 Recharge to learn what sets it apart from the competition, including its XC40 Recharge sibling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The raked windshield, low, fast roofline, and fastback hatch are what set this EV apart from its more upright counterpart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air deflector that trails off the roof isn’t just there to make the C40 Recharge look better.\n",
      "\n",
      "It hides the hinges for the tailgate to keep them from intruding in the interior and cutting further into the already meager rear headroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it’s the C40 Recharge’s dramatic take on Volvo’s taillights that steals the show with an animated startup sequence that begins at the bottom and zips up to the top of the lightning element upon unlocking the crossover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anders Gunnarson, director of exterior design for the C40 Recharge, told Green Car Reports he’s still frustrated that the taillights couldn’t be seamless with one lighted element and one piece of plastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "During development the plastic lens was cracking due to too much tension.\n",
      "\n",
      "This led to the vertical portion of the taillights having gaps as “one gap would look broken,” Gunnarson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The distinct difference is the C40 Recharge can be optioned with recycled plastic on the floor and doors in a terrific blue color (charcoal is the standard color) and there isn’t an ounce of leather to be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact,  leather isn’t an option .\n",
      "\n",
      "Textured topography trim that glows (though it can be turned off) at night is a new twist on in-cabin ambient lighting and is standard on the C40 Recharge.\n",
      "\n",
      "It feels, and drives, like  the XC40 Recharge , and even similarly to  the Polestar 2 dual-motor .\n",
      "\n",
      "Which is to say the ride is firm and buttoned-down, but never jarring even over Ghent’s cobblestone roads despite the standard 20-inch wheels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Road and wind noise are muted; it has less wind noise on the highway than a Mustang Mach-E.\n",
      "\n",
      "The true surprise is the nicely weighted steering that doesn’t feel overboosted in low-speed parking lot situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a “firm” setting that introduces too much artificial heft, but the normal setting is the perfect weight and allows the C40 Recharge to track nicely on the highway with no input corrections needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "One-pedal driving is easy to use in the C40 Recharge, with the ability to toggle a setting in the Drive Settings panel.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this feature off, the C40 Recharge can creep forward as a gas-powered vehicle would from a stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the one-pedal mode on, the C40 Recharge has strong regenerative braking that can abruptly thrust occupants forward if not modulated, especially at highway speeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "I rarely touched the brakes over the course of two days of driving, and found the one-pedal setup to be ideal for all but panic stops.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a 150-kw DC fast charger the C40 Recharge should be able to recharge from 10% to 80% in 37 minutes, according to Volvo, while 0-100% will take 8 hours on an AC charger.\n",
      "\n",
      "We didn’t have an opportunity to test any of the crossover’s charging capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Volvo expects the C40 Recharge to have an EPA estimated range of 225 miles, which is slightly more than the XC40 Recharge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The C40 Recharge is 6% more efficient due to being slipperier.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rear end design is 4% of that change with the remaining 2% coming from the 2.2-inch lower roofline and smaller frontal area.\n",
      "\n",
      "During my testing in Belgium, which consisted of both city driving and European highway driving with speeds somewhat comparable to what one will find in the southern part of the U.S., I observed Volvo’s range estimates to be reasonably accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "At high-speed highway driving the range will likely be close to about 200 miles in the real world based on my experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to whether there will be a single-motor, either front-wheel or rear-wheel drive C40 Recharge, Volvo spokesperson Russell Datz told GCR, “TBD.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Compromised\n",
      "For as good as the C40 Recharge looks, its packaging and some features are compromised.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up front there’s plenty of headroom for 6-footers, but the standard panoramic glass roof eats into headroom around the pillars for the mounting and safety hardware.\n",
      "\n",
      "In back, occupants sit on two layers of battery modules, as this EV still rides on the  ICE-based CMA platform like the Polestar 2 , creating a stadium-seating setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combined with the tall seat bottoms and fast roofline, at five-foot-10 I nearly skimmed the headliner with my hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the upright seating position and front seats being mounted high provide great forward visibility, the rearward visibility is severely limited from the driver’s seat due to the thick C-pillars and tiny, sloped rear window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just like the XC40 Recharge, the 9.0-inch touchscreen infotainment operating system is Android based.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the homescreen skin looks like the familiar Volvo interface, the functionally has been cut off at the knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Volvo UX design manager Anna Arasa Gaspar told  GCR  this wasn’t a functional limitation of Android, rather a conscious design decision by the Volvo team due to customer feedback and the desire for full-screen apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old system gave the option for either, there’s no longer a multitask option.\n",
      "\n",
      "This will come at some undetermined point in time via an over-the-air software update.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there is no AM radio, sorry sports fans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the EQB electric and Q4 E-Tron will both be slower, and have less power, than the C40 Recharge, but the Audi is expected to have slightly more range than the Volvo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the GV60 and Y will best the Volvo’s range and packaging, though it’s hard to call either pretty compared to the Swede.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time to shop online\n",
      "At $59,845 the 2022 Volvo C40 Recharge  will actually undercut a comparably equipped XC40 Recharge by $1,190 as it comes standard with everything from a heat pump to a Harman Kardon sound system and heated rear seats, all of which is part of the Ultimate package on the XC40 Recharge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though, a base XC40 Recharge with less features than its swoopier sibling still undercuts the C40 Recharge by $4,760.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buying the C40 Recharge will actually be a shift in the way one buys a Volvo: It’s only sold online.\n",
      "\n",
      "Datz did confirm to GCR that while C40 Recharges won’t be stocked on dealer lots and one must order one online, there will be at least one sitting at dealerships for test drives should a customer want to touch and drive one before clicking the order button.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yes, customers can order them while at the dealership, but it’ll be via the same webpage you’d order from while at home on the couch rewatching The Office.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those looking at an optioned XC40 Recharge who don’t plan to use the rear seat as often and are willing to give up a smidge of cargo room in the name of fashion, the C40 Recharge makes a compelling argument for itself with a chic design.\n",
      "\n",
      "As if carrying just one legacy name wasn’t enough, the 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E GT adds a second set of historical baggage by tacking on a pair of initials that mean something extra to Ford.\n",
      "\n",
      "The “GT” distinction has only been worn by a few vehicles throughout the Blue Oval’s history: Mustangs, the Le Mans-winning Ford GT40, and the pair of modern Ford GT supercars from the 2000s.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a vehicle full of GT firsts: first to be all-wheel drive, to be battery powered, and to be an SUV.\n",
      "\n",
      "It rides 0.4-inch lower than the standard Mach-E to lower the center of gravity even more, gets sportier front and rear fascias, and features a large GT badge on the liftgate as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also sport seats with more bolstering, upgraded brakes with larger 19-inch rotors front and rear, and wider tires than the standard Mach-E (9 vs. 8 inches).\n",
      "\n",
      "For early customers, this price seems to be worth it, a Ford spokesperson told us that the company was surprised by the number of Performance Edition orders it was receiving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Performance Edition adds upgraded Brembo front brakes, Pirelli P Zero summer tires, more bolstering on the front seats, and most importantly, a Magneride adaptive suspension that replaces the fixed suspension on the standard GT.\n",
      "\n",
      "2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E GT Performance\n",
      "More power, same range\n",
      "The GT gets a significant power boost over the other Mach-E variants, with peak outputs of 480 hp and 600 lb-ft of torque.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is a huge step up from the Premium/First Edition models that also offer AWD along with the larger 88-kwh battery pack, those top out at just 346 hp and 428 lb-ft.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Performance Edition, horsepower is unchanged but peak torque climbs to 634 lb-ft. Ford says this is because the stickier tire allows the motors to send out more power while maintaining grip, and thus the Performance Edition gets a higher peak power output from the battery than the regular GT.\n",
      "\n",
      "This jump in power drops the 0-60 mph time a full second, to 3.8 seconds for the GT.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Performance Edition is even faster at 3.5 seconds, which speaks to the difference that tires can make.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strangely, the GT doesn’t feel that much quicker off-the-line than the other Mach-E variants I tested—all of them feel pretty snappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difference comes from about 40 mph and beyond, where the standard Mach-E starts to lose steam and acceleration slows down quickly once you pass highway speeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the GT pulls and just keeps on pulling into extra-legal territory with quiet ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Ford announced the GT’s specs and pricing, we were surprised to find that the despite the additional power it would get the same EPA estimated  270 miles of range  as the other models with that drivetrain/battery combination.\n",
      "\n",
      "The numbers I observed during my time behind the wheel weren’t a good representation of the expected efficiency you can get in the GT; I spent much of the time pushing the SUV rather hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Performance Edition is the way to go\n",
      "The added torque is nice, but it’s not the reason you should get a Performance Edition.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s all of the other upgrades besides the power boost, most prominently the Magneride adaptive suspension.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a critical addition and a significant improvement over the GT's fixed suspension.\n",
      "\n",
      "The setup under the GT is fine under most conditions, but when the vehicle is pushed it has some trouble with the Mach-E’s nearly 4,600 pounds of weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's softly sprung so there's a fair amount of body roll in the corners, and since the suspension doesn’t control rebound well it sometimes hasn't regained composure in time for another corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combine that with numb steering and a tendency towards understeer, and it saps a driver’s confidence in quick, tight maneuvers.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the straight line speed in the world can’t solve that.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Performance Edition with the adaptive suspension however, needed stiffness is added when the vehicle is in its Unbridled or the new Unbridled Extend drive modes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This suspension does a better job of keeping the Mach-E’s weight in check and makes it feel more balanced and agile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combine that with the added grip from the tires and the more powerful brakes, and you simply feel much more in control from behind the wheel.\n",
      "\n",
      "On both the windy drive route and on the autocross course, this was much appreciated.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be nice to be able to change up the suspension settings independently (say if you're in an area with bad roads) and Ford did hint that such capability might arrive via an over-the-air update.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s meant to provide sustained power output for consistency in those environments, proactively cooling the battery and shutting the regenerative braking mostly off to control the amount of current flowing in and out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pedal mapping for both the accelerator and the brakes is more linear, the AWD system adds more rear bias (to a 40/60 front/rear split), and turns down the stability and traction control to allow more slippage.\n",
      "\n",
      "That makes it sound like this would be the most fun of the drive modes, but it turns out to be a huge letdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ford indicated that this drive mode cuts peak horsepower and torque significantly, and though exact numbers were not provided, trust me, it's a significant loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "It makes the Mach-E accelerate more like the Volkswagen ID.4, which isn’t a compliment for a performance vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unbridled will offer much better lap times and more fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unbridled Extend may protect the battery and make for even output over a longer period of time, but I’d rather go out in an Unbridled blaze of glory than go slower for longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "A more appropriate name for this mode would just be “Bridled.”\n",
      "Credits where credit is due\n",
      "The good news for those interested in the Mach-E GT, or any Mach-E for that matter, is that Ford estimates that it has enough full federal tax credits left to make it through 2022, even with the  F-150 Lightning  arriving as well next spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "That puts the effective price of a 2021 Mustang Mach-E GT Performance Edition at around $56,000 in most states.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s hard to say that the Mach-E GT lives up to the GT name, given that it’s so different from its predecessors.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of those vehicles offer this level of acceleration while at the same time being comfortable for more than two passengers with a practically sized cargo area.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Ford’s first stab at electric performance, this is satisfying, but there’s still room for growth and a stiffer suspension and more steering feedback would do wonders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up until now, those buying premium electric cars have faced a stark dilemma: Either choose the EV that represents the leading edge of performance, range, and efficiency—yes, that would be the Tesla—or choose the EV that’s a more holistic luxury car in terms of features, styling, refinement, and build quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2022 Lucid Air, with its EPA  range rating of up to 520 miles , and its shockingly small, “miniaturized” motors, gearbox, and inverter, should signal a reckoning for Tesla—and it’s clearly  rattled its crosstown rival .\n",
      "\n",
      "More than that, it’s the new leading edge for EV technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Air doesn’t mimic Tesla’s preeminence, but builds on it with a car that, from our first look, could be even more impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we’re calling this a first drive, it was more akin to a speed date.\n",
      "\n",
      "My total time in and around the car was limited to about an hour, with less than 30 minutes of actual drive time split between me and a drive partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "A comprehensive assessment of the car will have to come later.\n",
      "\n",

      "From a brief sample, the Air’s propulsion system has a sharpness and eagerness at nearly triple-digit speeds that I’ve never before felt in an electric car—yes, the Porsche Taycan and Tesla Model S included, although I haven’t yet driven the Model S Plaid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuned for comfort and fun \n",
      "Based on this short introduction, the ride and handling are a most pleasant surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The feel is fluid yet tidy.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I would have had an open stretch of tarmac like a skidpad, I would have tested if the Air is as willing to send power to the rear as it teases.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Air has no air suspension \n",
      "Pausing to look at the layout for a moment: Lucid considered an air suspension, like what’s used by Tesla in the Model S, but decided against it, mostly for one simple word that kept coming up: predictability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucid explained  a coil-and-air-spring setup has hysteresis, or lag, which started to lead to compromises in the damping that would affect ride and handling.\n",
      "\n",
      "We like the isolating yet responsive configuration the team came up with instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Air has a five-link strut front suspension, with an integral-link setup in back, with solenoid-controlled active dampers at all four wheels.\n",
      "\n",
      "The five-link front arrangement was added late in the Air’s development and was designed to purge torque steer and make sure that understeer and weight transfer stay the same whether in regenerative braking or foundation (friction) braking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Air has a mechanical variable steering rack that  has a very confident, easygoing feel on center.\n",
      "\n",
      "No need for launch mode—but maybe fast-charge preconditioning \n",
      "Buyers won’t need  any special workarounds or special conditioning to rip off 2.5-second 0-60 mph runs.\n",
      "\n",
      "They’ll just have to activate  Sprint mode and have more than a half a charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are no limits on repeatability either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast-charging can actually be more demanding on the battery, and owners may need to precondition the car, with interface details yet to be announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Air has the fastest DC fast-charging in the industry, at an actual 300-kw peak charging power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t get this confused with other EVs that list compatibility with 350-kw fast-charge connectors; the Air makes darn close to the most of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a consumption of 4 miles per kwh, Lucid says that amounts to up to a 1,200-mile-per-hour peak charging speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This car has presence \n",
      "The Air can be a bit of a chameleon in pictures, but I can assure you that up close, in person, it has a presence unlike any vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite having some of the best aero in the industry (at just 0.21 Cd), it doesn’t resort to the usual lozenge-like “kammback” design.\n",
      "\n",
      "In front, the thin micro-lens array headlights and smooth, low hoodline look aircraft-inspired, while the French curve arches around the back tuck into a signature look unlike any other from the rear.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've described the size and look as an elegant Dodge Charger as reconceived by Citroën, but that's only the superficial part.\n",
      "\n",
      "True to that first-class cabin cliche \n",
      "If the 520-mile range isn’t enough of a hint, the Air feels conceived for those who enjoy driving—even all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the back seat requires taller people to duck their heads when getting in,, that’s the only exception to the impression that the Air feels quite a bit roomier inside than the Model S inside, especially in back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unparalleled Glass Canopy roof brings plenty of light and a feeling of space.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trunk is roomy, with a flexible cover that can conceal a deep well at the rear.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can fold the split rear seatbacks forward to fit  larger items, or use the pass-through.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up front, there’s loads of leg room, and the seats offer a wide range of adjustability good for me, at a long-legged 6-foot-7.\n",
      "\n",
      "An optional Executive Rear Seating Package is on the way, adding what amounts to two first-class aircraft cabin seats.\n",
      "\n",
      "No eco-car calling cards, but lots of drive-mode choices \n",
      "While you might be in the longest-range EV on the market and one of the most efficient, the Air doesn’t constantly boast about it to the driver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Independently, you can select Hold mode or Roll mode for what happens when you reach a stop (with the former automatically applying the friction brakes when you do), and you can toggle idle creep on and off to change the car’s behavior when you lift off the brake pedal.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, to be explored later, perhaps on a track or skidpad, a Stability Off mode turns off the nannies while still allowing rear torque vectoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting the interface for a brand \n",
      "The Air’s instrument panel keeps critical information high, not far from the line of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The font used on all the displays—clear white letters against a charcoal background—is easy to read quickly and easy on the eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 34-inch-wide glass cockpit screen arcs smoothly in front of the driver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Split into three subscreens, it includes a gauge screen directly in front of the driver, media and communication displays up at the far right (smartly not far from the line of sight of the road ahead), and various accessory switches and controls on the left side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lower screen, called the Pilot Panel, houses things that you might access when at a stop—deeper climate controls, drive modes, navigation, charging, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "That whole panel is retractable, while physical hot-buttons for temperature, fan speed, and volume sit up top, in place no matter what.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few of the controls are unnecessarily odd—like the mirror adjustment that requires repeatedly tapping four directional button areas on the screen instead of simply dragging a finger in the direction of adjustment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of 1,111 hp: Barely a whisper \n",
      "Despite its shocking output numbers, the dual-motor system is near-silent inside the cabin and even at full rip emits only the faintest airy whistle, without motor or gear whine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wind noise, which can be noticeable in EVs, is also equally absent in this sedan, which has a remarkably low 0.21 coefficient of drag.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only minor gripe regarding noise was that, from the back seat, I heard more road noise—a “patter” on concrete from the wheel-well area—than I’d expect in a luxury flagship.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s a rather aggressive amount of regen when felt at speed, and enough to slow the car to nearly a stop in most situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "You won’t find steering-wheel paddles or gear selectors offering more temporary regen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on what I saw in a few limited stop-and-go situations, you’ll need the brake pedal for the last few feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucid doesn’t subscribe to brake-blending.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with Tesla, it’s a top-level philosophical choice: When you press the brake pedal, you’re using the friction pads.\n",
      "\n",
      "DreamDrive watches you \n",
      "Lucid boasts that because its  DreamDrive driver-assistance system  uses high-res Lidar (and 32 sensors in all, including cameras and radar and ultrasonic units), it works in almost all weather conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of those cameras monitors driver attention, and for now the system alerts the driver after 15 seconds but won’t cut off assistance as long as it sees that the driver is still paying attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although that’s subject to a final tweak in production, it cuts out the games like tying weights to the steering wheel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Takeaways \n",
      "We’ll be able to fill in many more details after a lengthier drive opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, I didn’t listen to the sound system at all, and the Air is the first production model from any brand with Dolby Atmos, as part of 21-speaker immersive audio.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also didn’t try Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, both of which are compatible with the infotainment system, or use Amazon Alexa for voice commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because these were pre-production demonstrators finnessed to woo media, analysts, and reservation-holders, I’ve withheld discussing things like materials and assembly quality—although so far the Air looks on the mark for a rival set that will include the Mercedes EQS.\n",
      "\n",
      "We hope in coming months to provide some real-world accounts of the Air’s range and efficiency, and tests of its charging numbers, which are better than those from Tesla.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lucid Air offers range and charging at the leading edge, but its appeal goes well beyond its tech leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elegant and understated, yet playful, the Air is likely the first of many glorious cars from a new automaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the road, it makes 3.0-second 0-60 mph acceleration runs look effortless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Off-road, its prodigious capability and quiet footfalls could be mistaken through the trees for a robot Bigfoot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together, from the outside and from behind the wheel, the R1T becomes so much more than the sum of its parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "After spending two days with it up and down the Rocky Mountain range outside Breckenridge, Colorado, it proved itself as the most versatile vehicle I’ve ever tested.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the range\n",
      "Sharing a platform with the forthcoming R1S SUV, the R1T uses a 135-kwh battery pack composed of 7,776 small 2170-format Samsung SDI cells stacked between the axles.\n",
      "\n",
      "An EPA-rated range of 314 miles kicks off the three trims available at launch, but Rivian plans a larger 180-kwh battery pack due in 2022 that will provide a range of 400 miles for $10,000 more than the $67,500 base Explore edition.\n",
      "\n",
      "A smaller 105-kwh pack is expected to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The motors work independently to make 415 hp and 413 lb-ft of torque for the front axle, and 420 hp and 495 lb-ft for the rear axle; together, the system churns out more than 800 hp and 900 lb-ft of torque.\n",
      "\n",
      "The R1T doesn’t use that power so efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its boxy design combats aero with a raked windshield and rounded corners, but despite the futuristic headband of light around the front and rear, the design is a modern take on a classic pickup design.\n",
      "\n",
      "It takes 48 kwh of energy to go 100 miles, and the EPA says that’s the vague equivalent of 70 mpg combined.\n",
      "\n",
      "The driver’s side front charge port follows J1772 and CCS standards, with DC fast-charging at more than 200 kw, enabling about 140 miles of charge in 20 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Level 2 Waypoints at 11.5 kw charge up to 25 miles per hour, or in about 13 hours overnight, and Waypoints are expected to exceed 10,000 chargers by 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rivian did everything imaginable, however, to make the R1T perform as if it were smaller and lighter.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the road\n",
      "The R1T has five drive modes—All-Purpose, Sport, Offroad, Conserve, and Towing—with five different suspension settings as well as settings for adaptive dampers, regen braking, and stability control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not every height is available with every drive mode, and most of them can go one notch above or below the standard ground clearance of 11.5 inches.\n",
      "\n",
      "The different suspension heights and drive modes give the R1T a variability unmatched by other vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you never fiddled with the settings accessible only through the 15.6-inch touchscreen, All-Purpose mode does what’s advertised.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conserve mode lowers the suspension to 9.5 inches, limits the climate control, and disconnects the rear axle, making it a two-motor front-drive unit with softer pedal mapping and a stiffer suspension setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I climbed to 10,000 feet, then descended a pass with a 6% grade and runaway truck ramps, the energy meter in the left side of the cluster danced like the readout of a positive lie detector test.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uphill, the readout plummeted; downhill, it spiked thanks to the “Max” regen braking setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we off-roaded on a 60-mile loop, with a 3,000-foot climb to ride the spine of a Rocky Mountain peak, we were gone from dawn to dusk—and, in the end, reminded that Rivian’s propulsion system is very efficient in lower-speed off-roading.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the onset we had about 180 miles of range; on the return, it was just under 100 miles remaining, according to the meter.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the road, the difference between Max, High, and Standard regen is not that pronounced.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Max mode, I learned up one-pedal driving smoothly enough by the second or third stoplight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most noteworthy road feature, however, was the acceleration and handling for a vehicle this big.\n",
      "\n",
      "It didn’t throw me back in my seat like a Tesla Model S P100D, but it took my breath away all the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also handles its weight far better than I wanted to test it ascending and descending mountain twisties with shoulder dropoffs into oblivion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to torque vectoring, adaptive dampers and its front double wishbone and rear multi-link suspension, Its agility comes, in part, from the world of supercars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two fluid lines between the front and rear axles offset inertia by limiting compression; if you’re turning right, the fluid fills on the left to limit compression and mitigate body roll.\n",
      "\n",
      "It enhances both on-road performance and off-road comfort, where the R1T impresses even more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Off the map\n",
      "Early in the morning, with the sun barely breaking the ridge to take the chill from my breath, we began our ascent up an old mining road.\n",
      "\n",
      "A creek divided woods crowded with fir trees and aspens.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Offroad setting has four sub-modes that automatically adjust the stability control and suspension settings in Auto, Rock Crawl, Rally, and Drift modes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not have the clearance to test Drift mode that turns the stability control off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The path got steeper and narrower until the walls reached the height of the door handles, even at a max clearance of 14.9 inches (the 34-inch tires add that other half inch).\n",
      "\n",
      "With that clearance and the lack of a great pumpkin, or rear differential, and the lack of the fuel lines or transmission cases you would have in a gasoline model, you can straddle rocks instead of aiming a wheel to climb over one.\n",
      "\n",
      "2022 Rivian R1T\n",
      "Cameras at the front and rear, as well as on the side mirrors, project back and forth to give visuals for where your eyes can’t reach.The dense trunks required me to fold the mirrors, shrinking the R1T’s width to 81.8 inches, which is a couple inches less than the F-150 crew cab.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rivian benchmarked the  Jeep Wrangler  Rubicon and  Ford F-150  Raptor, and though I didn’t do kick-up rooster tails in sand or rumble over any whoopsies, the R1T split the difference between the two.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it did it in the kind of unobtrusive quiet that made me feel a part of nature instead of an interloper in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Auto, the low center of gravity, wide track, and individual wheel travel made for balanced clambering even at a lateral pitch of about 20 degrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point, a front wheel slipped on ice and rock, but I applied more throttle so the three other wheels pushed the truck through.\n",

      "The R1T’s performance both on- and off-road is complemented by a gorgeous interior that’s a pleasure to spend time in.\n",
      "\n",
      "It makes the interior as warm and inviting as a ski lodge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lack of dials and buttons means the touchscreen is the sole interface for everything from the vent position to the side mirrors.\n",

      "The screen looks sharp, with large side bars for drive mode settings, pinch and zoom satellite mapping for navigation, and other cutting-edge features.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took a solid thumb press and the pre-production model lagged with some responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve grown accustomed to touchscreen reliance on other EVs, but with all the drive settings, including the off-road sub-modes, it can be a lot to process on a screen—or to make a precise selection on a bumpy road.\n",

      "\n",
      "Range\n",
      "When it arrives in January the long-range single-motor variant of the Polestar 2 is estimated to have an EPA-rated 265 miles of range, which is three more miles than that of the standard-range plus Model 3 (currently serving as the base model in the lineup).\n",

      "It has V-6 like grunt with that instant electric torque one will only find in an electric car.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its 231 hp and 243 lb-ft of torque are what one would file under “adequate” but hardly neck snapping.\n",

      "A base Polestar 2 doesn’t feel like a stripped-down economy car.\n",
      "\n",
      "The seats and part of the dashboard are covered in a fabric that looks and feels terrific, with an almost retro design that while not quite houndstooth, reminded me of that style.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trim on the dashboard and center console is a 3D-design that adds depth where wood simply looks dull and flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surprisingly, the base interior looks better in my eyes than the Plus Package and its reconstructed wood trim or the leather interior option.\n",
      "\n",
      "The single-motor Polestar 2 marks the introduction of the base model to the range along with a lower price point.\n",
      "\n",
      "That makes the single-motor Polestar 2 less expensive than the base Model 3 and just a bit more expensive than the Bolt EUV; the latter is ostensibly an economy car with a big battery pack.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I walked up to the Midnight Blue 2022 Polestar 2 it passed a personal test in the way no Tesla I’ve seen up close ever has: Every body panel lined up and was painted correctly, and seals were seated, and the doors close with a solid Volvo-like thunk.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the entire car had Volvo-like build quality, something that simply can’t be said of the Model 3, including the one my sister owns as her daily driver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still compromised\n",
      "For all that is good with the Polestar 2 the less expensive single-motor version doesn’t fix the compromised packaging at some level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Front seat headroom is improved thanks to the metal roof (instead of glass), but the car is still based upon an ICE platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rear seat is mounted stadium style, which has rear-seat occupants sitting up high, leering over the driver’s shoulder, and there’s a lack of headroom.\n",

      "\n",
      "For those who want an electric car as a daily driver, don’t need the Supercharging network to charge or take frequent road trips, and are willing to live with some packaging compromises, the Polestar 2 makes a lot of sense.\n",

      "\n",
      "Although the 2021 Hyundai Santa Fe Hybrid might be the only hybrid its size, it’s a darn good one thanks to a smooth, efficient powertrain, easy-to-use technology, and well packaged interior.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s connected directly to a 44.2-kw (59-hp) electric motor, which is powered by a 1.49-kwh lithium-ion battery pack.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other side of a clutch is a 1.6-liter turbo-4 producing 177 hp and 195 lb-ft of torque.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 13-kw starter motor/generator mainly helps the engine be on the ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "Total system output is an estimated 226 hp, and it all meshes together smoothly.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a light foot the Santa Fe Hybrid can pull away from a stoplight on battery power alone, but it won’t get very far or go very fast before the gas engine kicks in to augment with more power.\n",
      "\n",
      "The transmission layout helps this hybrid sound and react more like a traditional gas-powered vehicle—with smooth, clean shifts—than like the smaller Toyota RAV4 Hybrid and its annoying thrash when asked to hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instant burst of torque from the electric motor and battery pack enables the Santa Fe Hybrid to jump off the line quicker than any other Santa Fe model today, initially.\n",
      "\n",
      "The available 2.5-liter turbo-4 would probably take it in a 0-60 mph race, but that 0-30 mph sprint is probably closer than one might think.\n",
      "\n",
      "The electric power steering is light and unremarkable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asking for much feedback or for what’s going on at the wheels would be a step too far, but the front strut and rear multi-link suspension delivered a composed ride even on the Limited model’s 19-inch aluminum wheels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Efficient enough\n",
      "The Santa Fe Hybrid doesn’t have eye-popping EPA fuel economy ratings at 33 mpg city, 30 highway, and 32 combined in the loaded Limited trim I tested (the base Blue model has better ratings of 36 city, 31 highway, and 34 combined).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Kia Sorento Hybrid is more efficient, but is front-wheel-drive-only, whereas the Santa Fe Hybrid only comes with all-wheel drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vehicles like the Toyota RAV4 Prime and Hybrid along with Hyundai’s own Tucson Hybrid, which are a size class smaller, are simply more efficient—as is the significantly larger Toyota Highlander Hybrid, at up to 36 mpg combined.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those wanting more miles per gallon or a more efficient powertrain, the  2022 Santa Fe a plug-in hybrid is on the way  with 31 miles of all-electric range.\n",
      "\n",
      "Same great Santa Fe\n",
      "Remove the hybrid powertrain from the equation and the refreshed Santa Fe is the same well-packaged midsize crossover SUV it has been.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s no issue with 6-footers sitting behind 6-footers, the rear seat slides on rails to either expand rear seat legroom or cargo space, and it’s attractive enough to look at.\n",
      "\n",
      "The refreshed face is a lot to take in with a wide, gaping grille, T-shaped daytime running lights, and split LED lighting, but it’s not ugly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciate the fact that hard buttons for the infotainment system’s audio inputs, climate controls, and vehicle system controls such as drive modes supplement the touchscreen.\n",

      "They are grouped into pods that make logical sense and require no orientation or learning curve.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Santa Fe Hybrid costs $34,835, which is a $6,800 premium over a base non-hybrid Santa Fe, and comes standard with an 8.0-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, LED lighting, and automatic emergency braking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SEL Premium Hybrid model hits the sweet spot in terms of price at $38,785 with the addition of leather-trimmed seats, a 10.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system, and an impressive Harman Kardon sound system, though the larger touchscreen ends up trading wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for plugging in.\n",
      "\n",
      "My loaded Limited tester felt like no bargain at $41,640, though it’s the only way to get a surround-view camera system and heated rear seats.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not always ideal when there’s only one option on the table, but in the case of the 2021 Hyundai Santa Fe, it's a good one for those who need a roomy crossover and aren’t ready to plug-in but value high mpg.\n",
      "\n",

      "The 2022 Audi E-Tron GT and the RS E-Tron GT have arrived, giving Audi a pair of wonderfully sleek and futuristic electric vehicles that its E-Tron SUV and Sportback pair just can’t match in panache or curb appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "But these aesthetics are not the only thing that makes the E-Tron GT so anticipated; it rides on solid bones, sharing its platform with the high-performance  Porsche Taycan  that’s delighted us so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audi and Porsche both reside under the Volkswagen umbrella, and  the same J1  electric-car platform sits underneath each vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all share similarly sized 93.4-kwh batteries and feature the same dual motor all-wheel drive setup, with a 2-speed gearbox tied to the rear motor.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are more than a few important differences, because in addition to design, each company was responsible on its own to tune the suspension, steering, and throttle response.\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent the morning in an E-Tron GT and the afternoon in an RS, driving over mountain roads surrounding Los Angeles, to find where the two automakers split on philosophy, with a bonus stop at an airstrip to test the RS version’s acceleration in a safe environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "RS runs and runs and runs\n",
      "While the E-Tron GT and the RS have the same battery and electric motors, they differ widely in power output thanks to software tweaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The regular E-Tron GT produces 496 hp and 464 lb-ft of torque, which can be boosted up to 522 hp and 472 lb-ft for short bursts as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s no slouch, with a 0-60 mph time of 3.9 seconds, and some solid throttle response of its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it does feel like the E-Tron GT runs out of steam when accelerating past 70 mph.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s still got plenty of power for passing, just without the same snappiness you find at lower speeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are no such problems in the RS.\n",
      "\n",
      "It tops the power numbers of the E-Tron GT by a wide margin: 590 hp and 612 lb-ft of torque, with a peak of 637 hp when boosted (the torque figure remains the same).\n",
      "\n",
      "The RS’ peak electrical output from the battery—a difference in inverters—is 440 kw versus only 350 kw for the E-Tron GT, which explains the difference in power.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RS’ best quality is its straight line acceleration, as proven over multiple 0-100 mph runs made on the airstrip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the E-Tron GT, the RS pulls and keeps pulling well into the triple digits.\n",
      "\n",
      "That 3.1-second number is conservative.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was able to put up an instrument tested 0-60 mph run of 2.99 seconds with relative ease using the launch control.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not a Model S Plaid or the Taycan Turbo S, but it’s got absolutely silly speed by any rational measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was also very impressed that the RS was able to put up that kind of time in non-ideal conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was also done in 100-degree temperatures and my test vehicle had also just completed three slalom runs with the A/C and seat coolers blasting as well (though I quickly switched those off for the 0-100 run to pull the best time).\n",
      "\n",
      "Range similarities\n",
      "Despite these powertrain differences the range estimates between the two vehicles (both still unconfirmed by the EPA) are very close: 238 miles for the E-Tron GT and 232 miles for the RS.\n",
      "\n",
      "This drive did not provide an accurate range test, with long stretches on the Angeles Crest Highway.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this offered a suitable environment to test the car’s handling, I managed just 1.5 miles/kwh according to the trip computer thanks to some lead-footedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from the snappy throttle response, driving the E-Tron GT felt much like driving a more conventional vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also no one-pedal driving capability in either model and the braking regeneration is rather non-intrusive, letting the car glide quite freely in most circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Future Audi products may offer such a feature, but it seems to have intentionally been left out here for a more traditional experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Touring over tension\n",
      "The drive over the mountains gave the best indicator as to where the E-Tron GT and the RS line up against the Taycan, as both vehicles seem to have traded sportier aspirations for a more comfortable, grand-touring type feel (as the GT in the name would suggest).\n",
      "\n",
      "This setup does a wonderful job of keeping the Audis composed, even in its firmest setting the ride never devolves into choppiness—though on rough roads, be prepared for an intrusion of noise that interrupts the otherwise serene cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our  testing of the Taycan  has revealed it to be a sharp handling car, and while the E-Tron GT possesses good balance and a decent amount of grip, its steering is just not in the same league.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not the first Audi vehicle (even among the high-performance models) where I’ve been bothered by a lack of feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the RS E-Tron GT, your only customizations are the suspension, throttle response, and “engine” noise settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s right, RS models will also feature a unique “E-Tron sport sound” that was created from 32 individual sounds all mixed together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end result is a spaceship-esque whoosh that gets projected from two speakers inside and two speakers outside the vehicle, with the volume dependent on drive mode (Dynamic being the loudest).\n",
      "\n",
      "Watching the RS make its runs down the airstrip, the sound is easy to pick out whether you’re inside or outside the vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "A pet peeve of ours is when these systems can’t be turned off and the good news here is that you can, by way of the RS’ individual drive mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suspension and throttle response can still be turned up to their sportiest settings without the augmented noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Futuristic look, old-school interior\n",
      "The E-Tron GT’s interior offers the requisite comfort and materials quality expected from a six-figure car.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leather-free upholstery is standard as well, though each of the cars I tested both added full leather seating.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Audi’s front seats are a delight, with good support all-around and I left the car in the afternoon after nearly 6 hours behind the wheel without any of the creaks and groans from my back that my mid-thirties have started to expose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accommodations are not as comfortable in the backseat, it’s a tight fit back there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The E-Tron GT comes with a standard panoramic glass roof that helps the cabin feel more airy, but the RS has a carbon-fiber fixed roof that adds to the claustrophobia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the ultra-futuristic styling and noises the car makes, Audi made an old-school decision for the dashboard by neglecting to go for its two-screen center stack that shifts the climate controls onto another touchscreen lower in the driver’s sightlines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, you get conventional switches and buttons that are much easier to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that logic should apply to the rest of the lineup as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Performance costs \n",
      "Between the two vehicles, the RS is the more entertaining and appealing model but there is such a wide price disparity between them that I’m not sure it’s the one I would get.\n",
      "\n",
      "The E-Tron GT starts at $100,945 (including destination charges), but the RS jumps all the way up to $140,945.\n",
      "\n",
      "A $7,500 federal EV tax credit will still defer some of those costs, but a $40,000 gap in price is hard to justify.\n",
      "\n",
      "The E-Tron GT was a Prestige model that starts at $108,145, which added on the Performance Package ($6,000), Full Leather Interior Package ($4,000) and an appealing Tactical Green paint job ($595).\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding the performance package tacks on e-torque vectoring+, rear-wheel steering, power steering plus (adds boost at low speeds for easier maneuvering), and Audi laser headlights among a few more cosmetic additions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of those features are standard on the RS (except the rear wheel steering), so the addition of this package brings the E-Tron GT closer to its counterpart.\n",
      "\n",
      "My RS test vehicle was a Year One edition.\n",
      "\n",
      "That package has a $20,350 price tag and adds on every option available to the vehicle as well as 21-inch wheels, carbon ceramic brakes, and a black and red interior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audi says it will build as many RS models with this setup as are ordered, and for the first year of production at least this will be the only way to get the upgraded brakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "That brought the final price all the way up to $161,890.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an E-Tron GT you can have 90% of the fun for a lot less money, and given that the RS doesn’t offer any suspension or steering upgrades of its own, it gives the “base” model that much more appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "With neither of the pair offering a truly sporty driving experience, if you don’t need face-melting acceleration and can instead settle for face stretching acceleration, go for the E-Tron GT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to the playful Taycan, the E-Tron GT duo opts for a more sedate, mature driving experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’d be easy to hop behind the wheel of either, drive its full range down to the bone, and hop out feeling just as springy as when you sat down.\n",

      "On day two of the slog through soppy   Swiss Alps, I left it entirely in this latter mode and in Sport to get better body control from the suspension.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ride quality was on the firm side but superb all around, and while the 330e felt easy to plant into curvy-road esses, the default steering boost level felt too light, exaggerating the heft of the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all, the 330e feels heavier than its 4,039-pound official curb weight, which I thought I’d never say about a 3-Series.\n",

      "\n",
      "At 169.5 inches long, the EUV is slightly shorter than most of the subcompact SUVs on the market—all-electric or not—but it’s got a better backseat than nearly all of them.\n",

      "\n",
      "It will be hard to check the veracity of this claim until we can try to fit some big bags in both, but what I did like about the cargo area was an under-floor bin that isn’t counted in the cargo measurements.\n",

      "\n",
      "Representatives we spoke to indicated that the EUV’s added length helps keep the coefficient of drag between the two about the same, but the end result is a good piece of news for the EUV: the additional passenger room won’t really cost you much range.\n",

      "I was also impressed by the new technology offerings and the improved cabin materials and front seats.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Bolt EV getting a big price cut, which in turn brings down the price of a Bolt EUV as well, it’s a solid option up against the Nissan Leaf Plus.\n",

      "A dual-motor, all-wheel drive version with 312 hp is slated for later and that one is sure to be the much quicker of the two.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a roughly estimated 0-60 mph time of around eight seconds, the ID.4 doesn’t make any claims to be a speed demon like some of its other battery-electric SUV counterparts that are busy over there having some kind of a measuring contest.\n",

      "\n",
      "Even though it’s nominally an SUV and sits higher than the e-Golf, it exhibited impressive flatness and balance in corners, likely thanks to the new platform and its low center of gravity (thanks batteries).\n",

      "\n",
      "The Mirai’s look was loud and intended to draw attention to itself.\n",

      "But for its second go-round, the Mirai feels more secure in itself, more mature.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new Mirai has completely flipped from the former approach and it turns heads for a different reason: It’s a damn good looking car, more sedately styled and more attractive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The classic long hood/short decklid proportions give it an excellent profile and I prefer the more conventional front grille to the space invader schnoz of the outgoing car.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the makeover, the 2021 Mirai also moves to a rear-wheel drive platform borrowed from Lexus and comes with improvements to the fuel cell stack, the interior, and the technology throughout.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new car is better than the old one in pretty much every way, but the problem it will run into is that as good as it is, it runs into the same external limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Powertrain updated\n",
      "Many of the components of the Mirai’s fuel cell system have been swapped out for newer, smaller parts that help to save weight and allow the car to be packaged more optimally.\n",
      "\n",
      "It starts with the fuel cell stack, which has been downsized by 20% and is 50% lighter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its lithium-ion battery is sourced from one of Toyota’s other hybrid systems, as is the electric motor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system still works in the same fashion; Initial acceleration is started by the battery, then there is a transition to a mix of power from both the fuel cell and the battery, until the Mirai finally moves fully to fuel cell power at speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This transition happens seamlessly to the driver, there are no weird shudders or hesitations as the car moves from one power source to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Power output has increased to 182 horsepower and 221 pound-feet of torque, that torque number appears to be down from the previous generation but according to Toyota the gearing has changed so final-drive torque is actually increased in the new model.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the road, the Mirai’s acceleration feels similar to the previous car, which is fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "0-60 mph happens in a leisurely 9.2 seconds, but the Mirai has enough juice off the line for merging and feels strongest accelerating from around 20-45 mph.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the initial reports of the Mirai’s RWD setup might have spawned some dreams  of a fuel cell powered sport sedan , it isn’t that.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it does do one thing very well: touring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a quarter mile of taking off, I went over a bumpy section of road and thought to myself, “I am not driving a Toyota.” \n",
      "\n",
      "A look at the layout of the Mirai shows how this is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  three hydrogen fuel tanks follow a new layout  and are tucked under the floor between the wheels and the battery sits behind the rear seats.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this low-slung weight drops the Mirai’s center of gravity and on top of that, the new car has 50:50 weight distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "This combination gives the car incredible balance and allows it to have a pliant suspension that absorbs bumps and other road imperfections, without causing the sedan to feel too loose.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could drive a long, long way in a Mirai and be perfectly happy to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was also very impressed with the Mirai’s steering feel, a point of weakness for some of Toyota’s other sedans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of feeling vague and floaty, the steering is accurate and has just enough resistance to provide ample feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "It doesn’t quite have enough sharp turn-in to feel sporty but that’s fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cabin can get a bit noisy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mirai might ride like a Lexus but it has wind and tire noise like a Toyota.\n",
      "\n",
      "The greater auditory annoyance comes from the artificial engine noise that is piped into the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "It kicks in when driving in Normal mode and you accelerate enough that the Mirai’s cluster indicates you are in the ‘PWR’ range of eco-driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Move the Mirai to Sport mode and it gets worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "The engine noise is louder and higher pitched, and comes on whenever you touch the throttle at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eco mode is blessedly silent and Toyota says that the engine noise can be shut off.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’d recommend doing so the moment you get into the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "Down range\n",
      "The EPA estimated range for the 2021 Mirai has made a significant jump, to 402 miles for the Mirai XLE.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s a 30% increase over the previous model’s 312 miles and Toyota says that 20% of that increase comes from added hydrogen capacity, with the other 10% coming from improvements to the fuel cell system.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I hopped into the Mirai to start the day, it had a full tank of hydrogen but a trip computer estimated range of just 234 miles, well off the Limited’s estimated range.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toyota says that this is because the trip computer takes time to learn the driver’s style of driving to offer an accurate range estimates and the test cars had been mostly driven by journalists who like to drive more enthusiastically, shall we say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up until a fill-up that took place about two-thirds of the way through the drive route, I covered 63.5 miles and the range remaining according to the computer fell by 69 miles to 165 miles remaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was driving vigorously on a winding road (fulfilling stereotypes) for a decent portion of those miles and the trip computer also reported that I averaged 43 mpge over that time, far less than the Limited’s estimated 65 mpge combined rating.\n",
      "\n",
      "That knocked the hydrogen tanks down to around 60% full and to refill them took 1.823 kg of hydrogen and cost $30.16, or $16.54 per kg of hydrogen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mirai holds 5.6 kg of hydrogen and at that price, it means a full tank would cost just about $90.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thankfully, Toyota is continuing its program of covering three years or $15,000 worth of hydrogen refueling for lease customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Refueling times are still a bit longer than filling up on gas, it took about three minutes to fill the Mirai back up at that level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toyota says that all of the fueling sites should have H70 pumps in operation, with the H35 only available as a backup, but bear in mind that if the H70 isn’t working, you will be walking away with half of a tank (and half the range).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mirai  will still be limited in the areas it can be sold by hydrogen infrastructure , or a lack thereof in most cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that at launch, the Mirai will once again be a California-only vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of this writing, there are currently 42 hydrogen stations with more than 20 slated to open in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Toyota  partnership with Iwatani Corporation , recently announced, is helping boost that number in California.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five of the open stations are found in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island but Toyota says that is not enough to start to sell the Mirai in the northeast and more development will need to be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "But stations are only a part of the problem, as recent hydrogen shortages have shown.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one way, the Mirai has always been an incredible value because Toyota is surely losing gobs of money on each car it sells—both with the technology and the subsidized fuel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The redesigned Mirai ends up being both cheaper and more expensive than the old model, since it is now offered in two trim levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "The XLE ($50,455) is significantly cheaper than the outgoing Mirai, undercutting its price by $9,050, while the Limited ($66,955) is much more expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leasing the previous Mirai was a solid deal with the hydrogen fuel stipend that Toyota offers and that should be true for both leasees and buyers alike as that money continues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2021 Mirai is certainly much improved in this iteration, it looks better, goes farther, drives better, and Limited models have a nearly Lexus-grade interior as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The questions about hydrogen’s viability in the current market still remain, but as far as the hardware is concerned the new Mirai hits all the marks.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now after two brief afternoon drive sessions and about 140 miles, I can say that the Mach-E is on its way to feeling like something far more rebellious and subversive than decades of wild-horse branding.\n",

      "The Mach-E feels like it tries desperately hard to save face as a Mustang.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step inside and an inviting dynamic splash screen makes you feel like you’ve just bought a Mustang smart TV—in case you just missed the big prancing-horse emblems at the front or rear of the car, or on the steering wheel, or the door sills, or the hood bulge that hints of a phantom V-8 (instead, there’s  a lot of frunkin’ space  for tailgating).\n",
      "\n",
      "The screen greets you with a choice of three modes—Engage, Whisper, and Unbridled (basically: perky, calm, and performance-oriented)—and gives you the option to toggle on one-pedal drive behavior, ambient lighting for the cabin, and the propulsion sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably the best decision I made in getting to know the Mach-E was to turn off the propulsion sounds before I left the driveway.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried them later on, and it sounds all kinds of fake, a bit like a sample of induction engine noise overdubbed and mixed with Pole Position car sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the more you get to know the vehicle, the more they’re completely out of character for the Mach-E. \n",
      "Once I started filtering out this extreme branding experience and focused on just enjoying the car, things got much, much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "With my choice of leaving the one-pedal driving out of the mix for now and getting a feel for the rest of the car first, the Mach-E sprang forward from stop lights with quiet authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speed builds effortlessly in the Mach-E, but I felt it was easy to modulate with the rather long-travel, precise accelerator.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the dual-motor form I tested, the Mach-E makes 346 horsepower and 428 pound-feet of torque, and it can get to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The top GT models will raise the power to 480 hp and 600 lb-ft (with a larger front motor); and the Performance Edition will boost the torque beyond that, to 634 lb-ft, so as to complete the 60-mph dash in just 3.5 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without one-pedal driving engaged, the Mach-E scrubs off speed about like an automatic-transmission car left in Drive; tip into the brake pedal and the motors regenerate and then blend in the four-wheel disc brakes for the final feet of a stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one-pedal mode, though, the Mach-E decelerates abruptly the moment you lift off the accelerator, slowing all the way to a stop and then engaging the brakes; or if you need to stop sooner the brake pedal is instead activating the brake pads.\n",
      "\n",
      "One complaint is that the brakes in my test Mach-E were very touchy in parking lots or slow stop-and-go situations in the one-pedal mode—if say I wanted to pull forward a car length or two and needed to stop a little sooner than projected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steering tracks well, with a good sense of center and weighting that builds predictably off-center, and in my Premium 4X model it unfurled in a way that made the back-and-forth of a tight mountain-foothill road feel surprisingly graceful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mach-E’s behavior, and the way it divides its power between motors, tends toward safe understeer at lower speeds and sharp corners.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it can also help you when you’re aiming to go fast; on a freeway cloverleaf, I felt the system move more torque to the rear wheels and stabilize the attitude of the vehicle.\n",

      "The Mach-E is  the first non-Tesla to be able to hit 300 miles of range  in some forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just after receiving the Mach-E, I topped off the charge to 100%, and the trip computer woke up at 220 miles, well below this 4X version’s 270-mile EPA range rating.\n",
      "\n",
      "First thoughts on range\n",
      "Thus far I’ve covered 142 miles—aggressive driving that’s included several all-out launches, some blasts down backroads, and driving on the speedy side of normal the rest of the time, with outside temps in the 40s and the climate system set to 74—and I’ve averaged 2.7 miles per kilowatt-hour according to the trip computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "That puts me in line for going more than 235 miles on a charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mach-E is a little light on the efficiency gamification, and while I might have liked to see more readouts showing me where the power’s going in real time, the simplicity is bliss, and you can break down what percentage of your power went to different sources (15% of mine on my drives so far has gone to climate control, for instance).\n",

      "The 2021 XC40 Recharge sets the interface and user experience for a generation of other Volvo EVs to be offered over this next decade—and here, that's a minimalist-luxury approach that pushes the clutter (and noise) out of the way, and promises just the right amount of choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The XC40 Recharge is  set to arrive to U.S. dealerships in January 2021 , starting at $54,895 (not counting eligibility for incentives like the $7,500 federal EV tax credit).It’s at the small end of a class of crossovers that are called compact by American standards but can serve as full-fledged family vehicles if there isn’t too much gear to take along.\n",
      "\n",
      "In between, by American standards\n",
      "At about 174 inches long, on a wheelbase of 106.4 inches, it’s about a foot shorter overall and 7 inches shorter in wheelbase than the Tesla Model Y and Mustang Mach-E, and while seating space for four doesn’t feel dramatically different, the Recharge clearly has a lot less cargo space.\n",

      "\n",
      "Back-seat accommodations are well-apportioned, too, with plenty of head room and no lack of space to tuck your feet under the front seat—although there’s a rather high, squared-off hump in the middle of the floor that soundly makes the middle position a lot less usable for all but kids.\n",
      "\n",
      "The XC40 Recharge does have a frunk, and it’s not as large as those in the  Ford Mustang Mach-E  or  Tesla Model Y  but large enough for a couple of small backpacks or a larger duffel bag.\n",

      "At the reveal of the  XC40 Recharge , in October 2019, Volvo wasn’t yet ready to discuss the driver interface.\n",
      "\n",

      "Without that mode, the Recharge “creeps” forward gently when you lift your foot off the brake pedal, and it decelerates gently when you lift off the accelerator—basically mimicking the behavior you’d find in a gasoline vehicle, only perkier and more consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lifting off the brake pedal doesn’t create any forward motion; you need to tip into the accelerator for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "And any lift of the accelerator pedal brings on the regenerative braking quite abruptly, letting you slow moderately to a complete stop if you wish, followed a short time later by the faint whir of the parking brake to make sure you don’t drift backward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only when aiming to keep a steady speed on a steep downhill did I miss a middle setting between the standard mode, which required dabbing the brake pedal, and the one-pedal mode, which required feathering the accelerator.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one-pedal mode, the brake pedal feels firmer than it does in the standard mode; that’s largely because, as Volvo confirmed, in that mode there’s no additional blending-in of regen from the motor as you press the brake pedal—Tesla-style.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its default mode, the regen is blended with the friction brakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Volvo also confirmed something I couldn’t adequately get a feel for on my drive: The accelerator calibration is somewhat sharper in the standard mode, and more linear in one-pedal—likely to help reduce the amount of head-toss for your passenger in one-pedal mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside of that, your other dynamic choice is whether to engage “steering wheel firm.” After some quick A/B testing, I found it unwound more neatly in the lighter setting, though some might find the firmer mode more engaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also came to the conclusion that having “firm” mode on makes the steering feel heavy but not any more precise—and counterintuitively, slightly less relaxed on center.\n",

      "Easy decision which one I’d always use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buttoned down, but no ballerina\n",
      "The Recharge has a front strut, rear multi-link suspension, with stabilizer bars front and rear, and it goes without the likes of an air suspension or variable damping.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Recharge rides a lot stiffer than I was anticipating from my experience with other recent Volvo models (and the gasoline XC40).\n",
      "\n",
      "That can bring a little more coarseness in from outside, but it excels in keeping nosedive, pitch, and lean at a minimum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although you sit high in the Recharge, there isn’t the level of fore-aft body motion that can make the ride of some tall-riding but short crossovers feel unsettled.\n",
      "\n",
      "The underlying firmness, and neat-handling first impressions emboldened me to take it on one of my standard testing roads—a steep, sharply curved mountain road with imperfect surfaces and banking—at a rapid pace, but  the shrieking of the front tires revealed the Recharge’s 4,800-pound curb weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did one flat-out acceleration run up to 70 mph or a little beyond (on the advice of Volvo’s 4.7-second 0-60 mph time), and the Recharge leaps forward with quiet confidence; you sit fairly high, so it tends to feel even a tick faster than it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Recharge makes a combined 402 horsepower and 486 pound-feet of torque from front and rear motors, delivering “constant AWD” with a 50/50 torque split by default, but it can shift torque for the best traction.\n",
      "\n",
      "As good as the Recharge was in sorting out its traction off the mark, on a steep uphill, sudden prods of the accelerator produced momentary front wheelspin like a front-wheel-drive car, resisting (at least for a long fraction of a second) the idea of putting full power only to the rear wheels.\n",

      "First thoughts on range\n",
      "Range results from this short drive were promising—if you consider the context.\n",
      "\n",
      "The official EPA range of the XC40 Recharge is 208 miles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given a usable battery capacity of 75 kwh (78 kwh gross), that puts us at a maximum range of roughly 185 miles based on the kind of driving I was doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 30 of those were miles on the Interstate, aiming for typical travel speeds and mostly cruising at steady speed—where the Recharge proved well-blanketed from road and wind noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The remaining 10 miles was split between urban surface streets, at 20-35 mph, and on a steep up-and-down curvy backroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suspect the efficiency readouts were the consequence of the widely varied driving style as I was trying to get a feel for the vehicle and its capabilities in a one-hour snapshot.\n",
      "\n",
      "With its 11-kw onboard charger, a Level 2 (240V) charger can get it to full in about 8 hours, while it takes 40 minutes to go from 0-80% on a CCS DC fast charger, at a peak of 150 kw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Green Car Reports  anticipates getting a more balanced impression of the XC40 Recharge and its real-world efficiency, charging ease, and many connectivity features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until then, I can say that the XC40 Recharge is in a very smart position—not so much to woo Tesla drivers, but to show that Volvo can be everything it’s been and more in a fully electric model.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now those numbers are in and confirmed by the EPA—at up to 53 mpg city, 56 highway, and 54 combined—and after an afternoon behind the wheel, I can safely say that the Hybrid is tough competition for its affordable-hybrid competition, including the  Toyota Corolla Hybrid  and  Honda Insight .\n",
      "\n",
      "Familiar powertrain, different results\n",
      "The Elantra Hybrid’s hybrid powertrain is nearly identical to the one found in the  2021 Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid , combining a 1.6-liter Atkinson cycle inline-4 gas engine with an electric motor and a 1.3-kwh lithium-ion battery pack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Total system output is 139 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Hyundai, this is because the presence of the electrified drivetrain elements lessen the need to minimize mechanical loss from the transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, by using the electric motor’s augmentation you get the same minimization but without the drivability annoyances of a CVT.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the road, the dual-clutch basis gives the Hybrid a bit of a leg up in drivability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CVT really holds the gas version back from being a better car and though the Elantra Hybrid’s 6-speed is not great and can still hesitate or hunt around, it’s still a better experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Versus in the Ioniq Hybrid, one welcome change is generally quicker responsiveness to the accelerator pedal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Elantra Hybrid rarely runs on electric power alone at lower speeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The electric motor is actually used more extensively when coasting or under light acceleration at around 35-50 mph.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a bit of a shudder when the gas engine kicks back on, but it’s not intrusive to the driving experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elantra Hybrid models get a better suspension than the gas-versions as well, with a multi-link rear suspension setup versus a simplified torsion bar.\n",
      "\n",

      "The Elantra Hybrid’s multimedia options do have some weird quirks.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want wireless smartphone connectivity, it only comes with the smaller 8.0-inch multimedia screen found in the SEL trim.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Jump up the Limited trim and you add the larger screen and wireless charger, but that system requires a wired connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also if you’re an Android Auto user, it doesn’t use the whole widescreen.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a black box on the right that takes up about a third of the screen that you can’t get rid of, it actually makes Android Auto feel larger on the smaller unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Elantra has always had a larger interior than competitors and it’s nice to see that roominess has carried over to the Hybrid version as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is actually cheaper than the Ioniq Hybrid, its corresponding SEL ($29,395) and Limited ($32,195) actually cost significantly more than the Elantra Hybrid—a gap of nearly $5,000 for the SEL and $2,000 for the Limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ioniq Hybrid does have advantages in cargo room and a very slight fuel economy edge (58 mpg combined for Blue models, 55 mpg combined for the other trims), but that doesn’t make up for the price gap and I think the Elantra Hybrid isthe better driving car by a decent margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Corolla Hybrid’s 52 mpg combined splits the difference between the Elantra Hybrid’s trims and the Insight’s 52 mpg combined and 48 mpg combined for its top Touring trim lag the Elantra Hybrid slightly on both counts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toyota still insists on only selling the Corolla Hybrid in the LE trim level (for reasons unknown) and starts at $24,495 and that car is not as well equipped as the Elantra Hybrid.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Insight’s starting price of $23,885 does undercut a bit but that vehicle is also under-featured when compared to the Hyundai.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the top end, the Insight Touring sits at $29,795, more than the Elantra Hybrid Limited, and with a worse multimedia system and less advanced safety features.\n",

      "After my time behind the wheel, I came away from the 2021 Elantra Hybrid thinking that it was a decent car.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after that, as I dug into its value proposition and the unique feature set, its appeal grew and grew.\n",

      "Software and tuning goes a long way\n",
      "On the spec sheet, not much seems to have changed for the Accord Hybrid.\n",

      "Power output also remains the same, a combined 212 horsepower and 232 pounds-feet of torque.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is different for this year is how that power is delivered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honda says that all changes made to the powertrain come from tuning and software updates to improve drivability.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is very similar to the system that we tested in the  CR-V Hybrid earlier this year  and my experience in the Accord Hybrid was (predictably) pretty close to the results of that drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "This might instead be done to protect the battery, as a hard launch would put a pretty big dent in the battery’s charge (considering it’s only 1.4 kwh) and with the gas engine setup to only assist at cruising speeds that initial burst would be entirely dependent on stored energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "After you get past that initial pause, the Accord Hybrid catches up nicely.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s still some disconnect between the way the engine’s revs climb and the acceleration you feel, and the gas engine gets plenty loud at certain times, but the acceleration feels constant.\n",

      "I’m guessing I’d get used to it after a week or two with the vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much like in the CR-V Hybrid, the Accord Hybrid shines most from 10-40 mph.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this range the drivetrain feels extra torque-y and responsive, similar to driving a battery-electric.\n",
      "\n",
      "It made the Accord Hybrid more fun than I thought it would be to pilot on the same punishing canyon roads that I like to test sports cars on, it was easy to precisely accelerate and carry speed out of corners.\n",

      "Electric grace\n",
      "At highway speeds, the Accord Hybrid cruises along placidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was only able to get the gas engine to clutch in and drive the car by itself after I’d gotten up to speed on the highway.\n",
      "\n",
      "There could be a wider range of environments where this happens but it would take a longer test to find them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "High-speed passing acceleration is not as pronounced as it was at lower speeds, but it still moves in a reasonably quick fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honda also noted that the Accord Hybrid can travel up to one mile on battery power alone in its “EV” drive mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn’t get a good read on that claim, because the gas engine kicks on unless you’re very delicate with the throttle to a nearly unsafe degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gas engine also fired up the moment I get around 32-33 mph in my driving conditions, so it’s only a low-speed application as well.\n",

      "Starting inside—where it counts, really—a “bridge console” between the driver and front passenger helps give them their own personal space, and a two-tiered storage concept for smaller pieces up above and a tray down below that’s large enough for handbags.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, there are storage trays midpoint up the doors and a long tray that wraps most of the way across the dash, offering a wireless phone charger midway under the 9.0-inch touchscreen that is flanked by rotary knobs and physical buttons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sense of proportion inside feels different, even if it hasn’t changed much on the outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d just driven Toyota’s  Highlander Hybrid  the previous week, and with plenty of drive time in present and past versions of the Sienna the dash feels lower yet closer to the driver, affording good forward vision.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a minivan every little space is used, and in order to maintain the low, continuous floor for seating and cargo there aren’t very many places you can put the 1.9-kwh battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sienna was surprisingly in its element on a rather demanding, curvy road, and I’d venture to say it rivals any crossover, and tops most, for composure and ride quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the Highlander, its body motions felt tidy, and road noise was a full step quieter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite being roughly the same length and weight, the light, quick-ratio steering and suspension tuning made the Sienna feel more nimble, with a sense of maneuverability and a hint of sportiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "And despite some level of firmness from the Sienna’s chassis, which is all-new according to Toyota, the interior felt quiet enough to carry on a conversation with my daughter in the second row—without the “Driver Easy Speak” PA system—in this case, speculating about why the sunset sky was so spectacularly red.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the forest fires had their part, I suspect vehicle particulates do, too [nudge, nudge].\n",
      "\n",
      "Powertrain direct from the Highlander\n",
      "The hybrid system, which Kaehr confirmed has been transplanted almost identically from the Highlander Hybrid, feels adequate for power but little more; there’s enough zip for a sprint to 60 mph in what I’d guess to be about 8 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s slower than the former V-6, but quite a feat considering its much, much lower thirst.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toyota says that it’s worked both on the directness of the acceleration and the way the brake pedal responds; the brakes especially are very smooth and progressive now, with no low-speed grabbiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "By moving the shift lever to the left and tipping it forward or back (+/-), you can manually select a series of “gears” that don’t seem to help significantly with available acceleration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Selecting a lower “gear” increases the regenerative braking that’s available for sending power back to the hybrid battery, Toyota says, but the difference was barely noticeable going down a steep grade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over a 52-mile out-and-back loop that tends to show the strength of hybrids—with varied speeds, many small hills, and a 700-foot gain at its midpoint—I averaged an excellent 38 mpg.\n",

      "Over a 115-out-and-back loop on a mostly level stretch of freeway, on a calm, 68-degree day, setting the cruise at 71 mph (to go an indicated 70), I averaged 32 mpg.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s better than the 29.5 mpg we averaged in  more than 1,600 miles without a charge in the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid , but the Chrysler was loaded down and driven faster much of the time.\n",

      "\n",
      "What makes this remake so radical isn’t that there’s a hybrid Sienna.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s been long overdue, and the hybrid system’s well-proven.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s that Toyota has no intent to bring the V-6 back, and the hybrid’s the only way to get it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other models have variations of the 7-passenger layout, with two different types of captain’s chairs in the second row, including available super-long-slide versions that have a total of 25 inches of variability for an incredible amount of legroom.\n",

      "Calling out to the charging averse\n",
      "Clearly appealing to the portion of its audience who still might be apprehensive of charging cords, Toyota writes in its press materials: “Critically, the Sienna has no plug, and there is no need to ever recharge the hybrid battery pack, and certainly no need to spend a couple of thousand dollars installing a battery charger in a garage.”\n",
      "Critically, we truly hope Toyota’s working on a  Prime  version of this vehicle, as then it might soundly beat the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until then, the  Pacifica Hybrid  poses a unique proposition in the market, as it’s able to travel more than 30 miles all-electric.\n",

      "It's also teased  a 400-mile range  for some versions; although the Sierra EV might pile on more luxury features it’s likely to approach that number.\n",
